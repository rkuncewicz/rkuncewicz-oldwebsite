                    <p>I am currently a 3rd year student at Guelph University enrolled in a Bachelor of Computing Honours degree. I have always had an interest in computer and their inner workngs. Starting from a Windows 95 machine and a dial up modem, I was always wondering what went on inside of that big grey box. Pursuing this degree at Guelph is bringing me closer and closer to understanding all that goes on in laptops, phones, networks and much more. Computers are not all though, keeping a balanced lifestyle is very important for my every day life. I am part of the squash club, I enjoy mountain biking, cooking food as well as baking and I have a strong interest in Psychology and the working of the human mind. </p>
                    <p>
                    I have been programming for many years, slowly acquiring skills in Java, C, Python, Haskell, and any other language that comes my way. Programming is a passion, because it is so versatile in this day and age. Any problem that you run into can be helped by or solved using a computer, and finding the fastest and best way to do so is always a fun challenge. The biggest challenge that always seems to racks my brain is just that; the brain. To think that a computer that is faster and more powerful than anything that we can create on a chip is fascinating. Intelligence and consciousness is something every takes for granted, and we rarely stop and think exactly how all of it could have come about. </p>

                <h1>ASECO Integrated Systems</h1>
					<b>General Info</b>
                	<p>During my first work term I was given the privelege to work at ASECO Integrated System, located at 635 Fourth Line, Unit 16 Oakville, Ontario. Founded in 1988 ASECO is currently a global leader in manufacturing consulting and systems integration. Their ASECO include Manufacturing Consulting, Manufacturing Execusion Systems, and Controls Engineering. The primary industries they focus on are fiber materials, automative, consumer goods, food and beverage, steels, tobacco and much more.</p>
                    <div class="img_border img_fl">
                        <img src="images/ASECO.png" alt="ASECO" />    
                    </div>
					<p>ASECO works with partners such as Wonderware, GE, Rockwell, and Siemens using technologies which include ArchestrA, inTouch, RSLogix 5000 as well as other HMI and Control systems. Work at ASECO splits into ACS and MES, with the former dealing with the physical components on the lines and the latter dealing with reporting and data processing. ASECO is working in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, and expanding worldwide to meet the needs of customers around the world.</p>
					<b>Department</b>
					<p>I was put into the Controls Engineering department at ASECO learning about the integration ASECO for PLC, DCS and SCADA applications including requirements, design, development, testinng, commissioning and training. Working with Wonderware, Rockwell and Modicon, Controls offers a deep knowledge of a wide variety of control and SCADA systems which are used in batch, discrete and continuous control processing. All of these companies have their own languages and quirks that Controls needs to know, so sharing everyones experiences and knowledges is a core component.  </p>

                    </div>
					<b>Awards</b>
					<p>ASECO Integrated Systems is a recipient of the Wonderwares Most Certifications Globally and winner of the Control Engineering System Integrator of the Year. Working at ASECO it is no wonder that they have achieved these monumental awards, as they are constantly trying to improve themselves and the employees working for them. When not working on a project, employees are allowed to pick a certification they would like to try and earn. These certifications are very challenging, but it keeps everyone up to date on all the working technologies Wonderware has and allows the employees to expand their knowledge base. </p>

                <h1>Work At ASECO</h1>
				<p>Starting work at ASECO one quickly realizes that you are expected to catch up very quickly to the fast paced environment at the company. After basic training on concepts used in the company, you are put on a project quite quickly and are working with the members of your team right away. This at first can be a bit hectic, however you quickly realize that you must step up and work at everyones pace. Some words are quite taboo at ASECO for very good reasons, one of which is the word 'should'. When starting to work you are very tempted to say, "This part of the project <i>should</i> be done by tomorrow", or "Setting up the communication <i>should</i> only take a few hours". You quickly realize that these shoulds usually work against you and never turn out as planned. </p>
                <b>Intouch</b>
                <div class="img_border img_fl">
                        <img src="INTOUCH95.jpg" alt="Image 02" />    
                    </div>
                <p>One of the many technologies that I had worked on at ASECO was a HMI named Intouch. An HMI is a human machine interface, which essentially allows the operator at a plant to graphically view the status of the plant and make changes to it's functionality. Usually mounted as a touch panel, designing and creating an HMI can be tricky business. Colours are quite important when designing these HMI's, as certain colours can mean very specific things. Red for example usually is shown as an error, yellow as a warning, green as OK or running, etc. Depending on the project some colours can mean differen things, such as in the case when a dangerous machine is running it may display a red background, to show it is dangerous to walk into. Knowing the company and what line of work it is in is very important when designing these screens, as a simple lapse in judgement could mean problems. </p>
                <p>Being able to make everything readable, large enough to select, and fitting everything on a 1600x1200 screen can sometimes be very tricky. Designing each screen can be grueling work, making sure that operators do not have to switch back and forth between screens to view information is important. It is all about what the customer wants and needs when designing these screens, so you must think of how the operator will be performing these actions on a day to day basis. Using Intouch has helped me improve my skills in human computer interaction and taught me how to look at a user interface from the point of view as the customer who is using it regularly. When you think about how annoying some GUIs are to use, taking a shortcut is an easy choice not to make.</p>
                <b>Diesel engine</b>
                 <div class="img_border img_fl">
                        <img src="Diesel_generator_on_an_oil_tanker.jpg" alt="Image 02" />    
                    </div>
                <p>The project that took up most of my time at ASECO was working for a client that manufactured diesel engine for various facilities such as schools, mines, resorts and much more. We were put on a project to create a PLC program and creating an Intouch screen for the client. The PLC program was the hardest component of the project, because to be able to program and control a diesel engine you need to know how one works. This was quite challenging for everyone on the team, because no one had dealt with diesel engines before. The entire project lasted 6 months, which was quite a long time and a lot of work for the entire team. </p>
                <p>One of the major components in the project is trying to synchronize and connect the engine to the grid in the field. This engine is not the only one being installed into the grid, and as such it is problematic to hook up to the grid with other diesel engines. When the engine is up and running on it's own and the operator wants to connect it onto the grid, the engine must be perfectly in sync with all the other engines running. Synchronization involves matching voltage, frequency and phase before connecting the engine to the system. If the synchronizing fails before connection, it can cause a high current short-circuit, create wear and tear on the engine or on its own switchgear as well. The engine can run in three different modes: droop, base load or load share. These 3 modes are dependent on the operator and can be run differently under his discretion. Droop mode is the default mode and runs when the it is off the grid and running locally. Base load and load share both run when the engine is connected up to the grid and perform different tasks. Base load puts out a specific number of kW out to the grid, and does not rely on the grid to see if it needs a specific amount of power or not. Load share relies primarily on the grid to decide how much power it needs to put out and can put out more kW if the grid needs more, and less if it requires less.</p>
                <div class="img_border img_fl">
                        <img src="Oscilliscope 2.78.jpg" alt="Image 02" />    
                    </div>
                <p>We were responsible for shipping the panels for the engine, as well as all the software that was needed to run it. This required us to show the customer that all the panels and components that were purchased were in working order and were properly running. One of the main components in the system was the DSLC which was what synchronized the engine onto the grid. As was mentioned previously, failure to synchronize the engine would create a huge load on the system. To test it we needed to put a known load on the system so that we could test it accurately. To do so we put 3 bulbs in an open delta transformation and needed to fake out the multimeter so that it would read a 4200V line and a 1200 amp line. To fake these values, instead of the multimeter reading the voltage directly from the line, it would be reading it from the values we were faking. To show the customer everything was working properly we brought out an oscilloscope so that we could see the sin waves of the faked values and the 'grid'. We showed that the DSLC was working properly by letting is synchronize and observing the two sin waves coming into sync with each other.</p>

            <div class="section" id="goals" style="overflow: auto;"> 
               	<h1>Workterm Goals</h1>
                <b>Managing Self - Learning</b>
                <p>Arriving at ASECO I quickly realized that a large portion of my employees had degrees in Engineering, and that much of the work was focused in this field. I set an objective for myself to go outside my degree in Computer Science and try to learn more in terms of electrical engineering and systems engineering so that I could work better at ASECO. I had planned to read extra material on my own time, or when I had down time, to catch up on some of the topics that I did not have much knowledge about. This involved reading books that were available in the office or looking at Wikipedia about certain topics. At the end of my work term I can say that I had a huge set of knowledge dealing with electrical engineering, diesel engines and generators and many other topics that I had not previously known about. It was a great learning experience and I believe that the work I put into trying to learn these different skills helped my time at ASECO.</p>
                <b>Communicating - Interpersonal</b>
                <p>Another of my goals was trying to keep good personal connections and relationships with everyone in the office and to try and get involved with activities that were happening around the office. I tried to accomplish the first part by being active around the office and getting to know everyone in Controls as well as different parts of the office. I found that even spending 5 minutes with someone asking about their day helped people know who you were and remember your face much easier. Going out to lunch with people and sometimes going to places after work also helped improve my relation with everyone in the office. In terms of participating in activities I played soccer many weeks after work, there were poker nights in which I participated in and there was a paintballing day in which many people from the office came out to paintball. I found that going out of the work environment and spending time with everyone is quite different than in the office. People are quite relaxed and show a different side of themselves that you may never see inside of the office.</p>
                <b>Managing People & Tasks - Leadership & Influence</b>
                <p>My third goal was based on the fact that I realized much of my department was engineering based, and I wanted to help everyone by bringing in my skills as a computer scientist to the department. I was hoping to help automate work done in the office by creating some programs that would help coworkers to do their work faster. When I was working under Kevin McCully I had helped automate and create reports that were required to be generated each week that was originally being done by hand. Using Reporting Services combined with T-SQL I helped automate this report and cut down on time spent putting together statistics and graphs. I had also helped individual employees with their work by showing them some shortcuts they could use in various programs that they might not have known before. These helped quite a bit, however I noticed that when you are working on a certain project it is quite hard to spend your time working for the company. The customer is always waiting and you are being paid to work on the customers project, not on individual projects. Due to this, I did not accomplish my goal as well as I had liked to, however it just means I have to try harder next time.</p>
                <b>Misc.</b>
                <p>The one thing that I did not write on the goals sheet, because I did not realize it was a point I had to work on, was the amount of time I estimated I would be working on certain projects. At first I believed I could accurately estimate the time I would be working on certain things, however I quickly realized that I was severely underestimating the amount of time I was working on some tasks. Sometimes it hindered the team when they were waiting for a certain part of the project and it was held back because I was still working on it. Slowly over the semester I was better at being able to tell how long it would take me to finish something and I added 10% longer in case problems arose. I found that your boss is much happier when you bring him something early, rather than bringing is later than what you said.  </p>

                <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
                <p>ASECO was an amazing place to work at for my first work term, I could not have asked for a better experience. The people working at the company are amazing, the environment is fantastic and I learned more than I could ever imagine at ASECO. I would like to thank everyone in the company for treating me like one of their own and helping me through the process! I wouldn't hesitate recommending ASECO as a place to work, I am sure anyone would enjoy their time there.</p>
