                    <p>I am currently a 3rd year student at Guelph University enrolled in a Bachelor of Computing Honours degree. I have always had an interest in computer and their inner workngs. Starting from a Windows 95 machine and a dial up modem, I was always wondering what went on inside of that big grey box. Pursuing this degree at Guelph is bringing me closer and closer to understanding all that goes on in laptops, phones, networks and much more. Computers are not all though, keeping a balanced lifestyle is very important for my every day life. I am part of the squash club, I enjoy mountain biking, cooking food as well as baking and I have a strong interest in Psychology and the working of the human mind. </p>
                    <p>
                    I have been programming for many years, slowly acquiring skills in Java, C, Python, Haskell, and any other language that comes my way. Programming is a passion, because it is so versatile in this day and age. Any problem that you run into can be helped by or solved using a computer, and finding the fastest and best way to do so is always a fun challenge. The biggest challenge that always seems to racks my brain is just that; the brain. To think that a computer that is faster and more powerful than anything that we can create on a chip is fascinating. Intelligence and consciousness is something every takes for granted, and we rarely stop and think exactly how all of it could have come about. </p>

                <h1>ASECO Integrated Systems</h1>
					<b>General Info</b>
                	<p>During my first work term I was given the privelege to work at ASECO Integrated System, located at 635 Fourth Line, Unit 16 Oakville, Ontario. Founded in 1988 ASECO is currently a global leader in manufacturing consulting and systems integration. Their ASECO include Manufacturing Consulting, Manufacturing Execusion Systems, and Controls Engineering. The primary industries they focus on are fiber materials, automative, consumer goods, food and beverage, steels, tobacco and much more.</p>
					<p>ASECO works with partners such as Wonderware, GE, Rockwell, and Siemens using technologies which include ArchestrA, inTouch, RSLogix 5000 as well as other HMI and Control systems. Work at ASECO splits into ACS and MES, with the former dealing with the physical components on the lines and the latter dealing with reporting and data processing. ASECO is working in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, and expanding worldwide to meet the needs of customers around the world.</p>
					<b>Department</b>
					<p>I was put into the Controls Engineering department at ASECO learning about the integration ASECO for PLC, DCS and SCADA applications including requirements, design, development, testinng, commissioning and training. Working with Wonderware, Rockwell and Modicon, Controls offers a deep knowledge of a wide variety of control and SCADA systems which are used in batch, discrete and continuous control processing. All of these companies have their own languages and quirks that Controls needs to know, so sharing everyones experiences and knowledges is a core component.  </p>
					<b>Awards</b>
					<p>ASECO Integrated Systems is a recipient of the Wonderwares Most Certifications Globally and winner of the Control Engineering System Integrator of the Year. Working at ASECO it is no wonder that they have achieved these monumental awards, as they are constantly trying to improve themselves and the employees working for them. When not working on a project, employees are allowed to pick a certification they would like to try and earn. These certifications are very challenging, but it keeps everyone up to date on all the working technologies Wonderware has and allows the employees to expand their knowledge base. </p>

                <h1>Work At ASECO</h1>
				<p>Starting work at ASECO one quickly realizes that you are expected to catch up very quickly to the fast paced environment at the company. After basic training on concepts used in the company, you are put on a project quite quickly and are working with the members of your team right away. This at first can be a bit hectic, however you quickly realize that you must step up and work at everyones pace. Some words are quite taboo at ASECO for very good reasons, one of which is the word 'should'. When starting to work you are very tempted to say, "This part of the project <i>should</i> be done by tomorrow", or "Setting up the communication <i>should</i> only take a few hours". You quickly realize that these shoulds usually work against you and never turn out as planned. </p>
                <h1>Intouch</h1>
                <p>One of the many technologies that I had worked on at ASECO was a HMI named Intouch. An HMI is a human machine interface, which essentially allows the operator at a plant to graphically view the status of the plant and make changes to it's functionality. Usually mounted as a touch panel, designing and creating an HMI can be tricky business. Colours are quite important when designing these HMI's, as certain colours can mean very specific things. Red for example usually is shown as an error, yellow as a warning, green as OK or running, etc. Depending on the project some colours can mean differen things, such as in the case when a dangerous machine is running it may display a red background, to show it is dangerous to walk into. Knowing the company and what line of work it is in is very important when designing these screens, as a simple lapse in judgement could mean problems. </p>
                <p>Being able to make everything readable, large enough to select, and fitting everything on a 1600x1200 screen can sometimes be very tricky. Designing each screen can be grueling work, making sure that operators do not have to switch back and forth between screens to view information is important. It is all about what the customer wants and needs when designing these screens, so you must think of how the operator will be performing these actions on a day to day basis. Using Intouch has helped me improve my skills in human computer interaction and taught me how to look at a user interface from the point of view as the customer who is using it regularly. When you think about how annoying some GUIs are to use, taking a shortcut is an easy choice not to make.</p>
                <h1>Generator</h1>
                <p>The project that took up most of my time at ASECO was working for a client that manufactured diesel generators for various facilities such as schools, mines, resorts and much more. We were put on a project to create a PLC program and creating an Intouch screen for the client. </p>
